            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>How do I know what level of mental health care my teenager needs?</h3>
            <p>The appropriate level of care depends on the severity of symptoms, safety concerns, and functional impairment. Start with a comprehensive assessment from a mental health professional who can recommend the most appropriate treatment setting. Emergency departments can provide crisis assessment, while outpatient providers can conduct thorough evaluations for non-urgent situations.</p>

            <h3>Will my insurance cover teen mental health treatment in Florida?</h3>
            <p>Most insurance plans in Florida are required to cover mental health treatment at the same level as physical health care (mental health parity). This includes individual therapy, group therapy, and psychiatric services. Coverage varies by plan, so review your specific benefits or call your insurance company to verify coverage for teen mental health services.</p>

            <h3>What should I do if there are no teen mental health specialists available in my area?</h3>
            <p>Consider virtual therapy options, which give you access to teen specialists throughout Florida. Many community mental health centers also provide sliding-scale services and may have shorter waiting lists. School-based services can provide immediate support while you search for community providers. Mobile crisis teams can also help assess needs and connect you with resources.</p>

            <h3>How can I get mental health support for my teen if we don't have insurance?</h3>
            <p>Florida offers several options for uninsured families including community mental health centers with sliding-scale fees, federally qualified health centers, university training clinics, and state-funded programs. Apply for Florida KidCare or Medicaid, as your family may qualify for free or low-cost coverage. Many hospitals also offer charity care programs for mental health services.</p>

            <h3>What rights do parents have regarding their teen's mental health treatment?</h3>
            <p>Parents generally have the right to make mental health treatment decisions for children under 18, though teens' confidentiality rights increase with age. In Florida, teens 13 and older can consent to outpatient mental health treatment, but parents typically retain access to general information about treatment progress. For specific situations, consult with mental health providers or legal professionals about parental rights and teen confidentiality.</p>
