            <h3>How effective is online counseling for teen depression in West Palm Beach?</h3>
            <p>Research demonstrates that online counseling is as effective as in-person therapy for teen depression, with success rates of 80-85% for moderate to severe depression. For West Palm Beach teens, online therapy offers additional benefits by eliminating transportation barriers and providing consistent treatment regardless of weather or traffic conditions. The key is working with therapists experienced in both teen depression and virtual treatment delivery.</p>

            <h3>What if my West Palm Beach teen is resistant to online therapy?</h3>
            <p>Many depressed teens initially resist any form of treatment. Online therapy can actually be less threatening than traditional therapy because it happens in their comfortable home environment. We work with parents to engage resistant teens gradually, often starting with brief check-ins and building to full sessions. The technology-based format often appeals more to teens than traditional office visits.</p>

            <h3>Can online therapy help with severe depression requiring immediate attention?</h3>
            <p>Online therapy can effectively treat severe depression with proper safety protocols in place.

For acute crisis situations, we connect families with emergency services at St. Mary's Medical Center or JFK North while maintaining therapeutic support.</p>

            <h3>What role do parents play in online depression treatment?</h3>
