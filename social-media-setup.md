### Press Release #2: Teen Mental Health Awareness

**HEADLINE:** Florida Teen Mental Health Statistics Show Urgent Need for Accessible Treatment Options

**SUBTITLE:** Avela Therapy Responds to 40% Increase in Teen Anxiety and Depression Cases with Virtual Therapy Services

**FLORIDA** - December 6, 2024 - Recent data shows that teen mental health challenges in Florida have increased by 40% over the past three years, prompting Avela Therapy to expand virtual therapy services specifically designed for teenagers struggling with anxiety, depression, trauma, and ADHD.

According to the Florida Department of Health, approximately 1 in 5 teenagers in the state experiences a mental health condition, with anxiety and depression being the most common diagnoses. However, access to specialized teen mental health services remains limited, particularly in rural and underserved areas.

"Virtual therapy is breaking down traditional barriers to mental health care," explained Dr. Tommy McGee, LCSW, who specializes in teen trauma and depression treatment at Avela Therapy. "Teenagers often feel more comfortable opening up in their own environment, and parents appreciate the convenience and privacy of virtual sessions."

The practice has seen particular success in treating:
- Teen anxiety disorders (affecting 25% of adolescents)
- Teen depression (affecting 15% of adolescents)  
- ADHD in teenagers (affecting 11% of adolescents)
- School refusal and attendance issues
- Teen trauma recovery

Avela Therapy accepts most major Florida insurance plans and offers immediate appointments for families in crisis.

"Early intervention is crucial for teen mental health," said Dr. Raju Mangrola, the practice's board-certified psychiatrist. "The sooner we can connect teenagers with appropriate treatment, the better their long-term outcomes."

For immediate support, call the Avela Therapy crisis line at (561) 614-2857 or visit https://avelatherapy.com for more information.
